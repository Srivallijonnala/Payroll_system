# Payroll_system
This payroll management system manages employee data, including unique IDs, SSNs, and salaries. It allows dynamic updates to allowances like Travelling, Dearness, and House Rent. Income is calculated by adding allowances to the basic salary, and employees' records can be added, displayed, and managed efficiently.
